# Description

A simple Python, command-line application that will calculate the ranking table for a soccer league.

The following rules are applied : 

- In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0points. 
If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same
rank and be printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample
data).
